# Bike-Stores-Project

This is another project to better understand the manipulation of data in order to achieve the necessary data to create presentable dashboards.
This project involved using MSSQL to create a compact table out of numerous tables and data using queries.
Then, I created 2 dashboards, the first using Microsoft Excel with pivot tables and charts and the second on Tableau Public.
